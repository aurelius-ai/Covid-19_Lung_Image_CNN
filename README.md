# Covid-19_Lung_Image_CNN
The dataset used has a large amount of variation in the angles the xrays were taken. This project presents a high resolution neural network to predict the presence of Covid-19 in chest xrays. The validation acuracy consistantly results in above 70% validation accuracy with some datasets presenting higher than 81.25% validation accuracy.
The data used for training and validation can be found below.
